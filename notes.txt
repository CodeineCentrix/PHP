1) It all begins in the UI where someone performs an action ...

2) Track what the action is... Using UI Javascript or UI native languages

3) Send the action to the controller.. via a post or get then controller will decide what is being requested

4) Let the controller get the data if there is data required for the action to be complete

5) Let the controller make appropriate objects and call methods.. 
5a) Map the objects to relevant Model classes
5b) Let the Model send or retrieve the data to the database via the dedicated DAL chain 

6) Let the controller return the result or result set

7) Let the controller include the web page also providing data for that web page

8) In the web page use the data requested from the Controller to fill controls

<--- Approach for new articles -->
Multiple records in database but only want to display a few? 
then use offset fetch inside of your stored procedure Eg: 
Skip first 10 rows from the sorted result set and return the remaining rows.
SELECT First Name + ' ' + Last Name FROM Employees ORDER BY First Name OFFSET 10 ROWS; 
Version 2  of the above 
 Skip first 10 rows from the sorted resultset and return next 5 rows.
SELECT First Name + ' ' + Last Name FROM Employees ORDER BY First Name OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
