                        <label>Impofu Dam is at 38.5% capacity, Kouga Dam is battling a lot and is at 10.9%, Swartkops Dam is at 50.7% and Loerie is the only dam with 100.3% last week. The department has appealed to the communities of Nelson Mandela Bay and Sarah Baartman municipalities to continue saving water during this period of drought.

Meanwhile, the Amathole Water Supply System, serving dams in Buffalo City Municipality has shown some signs of recovery in recent weeks, improving from 88.9% the previous week to 90.4% last week.

Klipplaat is standing at 70.3%, a huge improvement compared to the previous year at this time, when it was at 58.1%.<br><br>

Gubu Dam was at 100.8% capacity last week; Laing Dam is at 100.4%, and Rooikrantz Dam remains at 100.8%.

“Another major concern is Xilinxa Dam in Butterworth, which is still as low as 25.5% and residents of this area are urged to head the calls for water conservation and take them seriously.

“Water users are further reminded that Eastern Cape has been declared as a national disaster area due to acute water challenges and reduction in water usage will play a huge role in ensuring that we avoid running out of water.” – REPORTER
