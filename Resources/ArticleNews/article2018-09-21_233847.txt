<p>An exceptional turnaround for the Nelson Mandela Bay dams has left locals jumping for joy, after months of tension and fear left the metro starting down the barrel of a day zero crisis.</p>

<p>The NMB Council have revealed that their dam levels now stand at 49.41%. Rewind back to the end of August, and that number was a miserly 17.4%. The two-week recovery &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesouthafrican.com/nelson-mandela-bay-dams-water-levels-monday-10-september-video/" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(247, 13, 40); text-decoration-line: none;">all down to the biblical rain</a>&nbsp;that fell within the first week of September &ndash; has seen water levels increase nearly three-fold.</p>

<p>Nowhere is that recovery more impressive than at Churchill dam.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nelsonmandelabay.gov.za/dam.aspx" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(247, 13, 40); text-decoration-line: none;">The parched facility was languishing at just 16% full a fortnight ago</a>. Now, it&rsquo;s officially broken the 100% mark.</p>

<p>Another astounding feat is the bouncebackability shown by the Kouga dam. When water levels at the facility dropped below the 7% mark, there was plenty to fear. Residents of the nearby towns of Hankey and Patensie were put onto&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesouthafrican.com/eastern-cape-water-shedding-monday-6-august/" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(247, 13, 40); text-decoration-line: none;">a strict water shedding schedule</a>, where they went without water for 16 hours a day.</p>

<p>However, Kouga is now more than 45% full, almost matching the combined average. The Impofu dam &ndash; the largest reverse servicing NMB &ndash; also climbed up a few percentage points to 34.3%.</p>
